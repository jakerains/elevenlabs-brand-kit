# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.2.2] - April 14, 2026

### Added
- Pre-flight check (Step 0) runs silently before asking any questions — detects existing central installs, outdated versions, and already-linked projects
- Quick-link fast path (Path A) — when central assets are already installed and current, just asks project type, symlinks, and bootstraps. No redundant download or storage questions.
- Path-based routing (Step 1) with 5 paths: existing central (A), outdated (B), first-time (C), missing assets (D), already installed (E)
- Central storage now writes `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to `~/.elevenlabs-kit/` — full brand identity, color tokens, typography, icon selection, and compliance checklist so any AI agent that accesses the central store stays on-brand
- Brand compliance check (`/elevenlabs-brand-kit:brand`) invoked automatically after asset setup completes

### Fixed
- Remotion bootstrap: broken `Cannot find module 'react/jsx-runtime'` — now delegates to Remotion's official scaffolder (`create-video`) which installs React peers, TypeScript, config files, and entry points correctly; includes manual fallback with explicit `react react-dom` and dev deps
- Remotion bootstrap: added smoke test (`react/jsx-runtime` resolve + `remotion versions`) to catch install failures before the user runs studio

### Changed
- Asset-setup flow restructured: config check happens before any user interaction, not after. Returning users with central storage get a near-instant setup experience.
- Storage preference only asked for first-time setup (Path C) — returning users with an existing central install skip straight to project type
- Remotion studio launch instructions simplified to `studio`

## [3.2.1] - April 14, 2026

### Added
- Remotion project type now auto-initializes `package.json` if missing, installs Remotion when absent, and wires up a `studio` npm script so users can launch Remotion Studio with `npm run studio`

## [3.2.0] - April 14, 2026

### Added
- Branded PPTX skill (`eleven-branded-pptx`) — create ElevenLabs-branded PowerPoint presentations from the included 30-slide template
- Standalone `.skill` file for Claude Desktop / Cowork Desktop — self-contained branded PPTX with 54 embedded media files
- Presentations project type in asset-setup — guides users to the branded PPTX workflow
- AskUserQuestion UI for all asset-setup prompts — clean selection interface instead of raw text
- Quick-nav badges in README for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Brand Assets, and Skills
- Marketplace install instructions (`/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install`)

### Changed
- Renamed `branded-pptx` skill to `eleven-branded-pptx` across all references
- Plugin source switched from GitHub clone to relative path — avoids redundant re-clone during install
- Plugin manifest `repository` field uses string format per Claude Code schema

### Fixed
- Plugin install failure caused by SSH clone attempt on public repo (permission denied publickey)
- `.skill` download links now point to GitHub release assets
- Template file renamed to remove special characters that broke downloads
- Dark mode logo rendering in README
- Asset-setup references updated to v3.1.0 release URL

## [2.0.0] - April 10, 2026

### Added
- New `branded-web` skill — guidance for building ElevenLabs-branded web experiences (HTML, CSS, React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- 7 web-specific rule files: css-tokens, tailwind-setup, shadcn-theming, card-variants, backgrounds, typography-web, voice-orbs-web

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rebrand from "ElevenLabs Remotion Kit" to "ElevenLabs Brand Kit"
- **BREAKING:** Plugin name changed from `elevenlabs-remotion-kit` to `elevenlabs-brand-kit` — all skill commands now use `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:` prefix
- README restructured with brand-first positioning; Remotion skills presented as one workflow
- brand-assets/CLAUDE.md updated to be framework-agnostic with web usage examples
- brand-assets/index.html catalog updated: "Remotion Catalog" → "Brand Catalog", copy payloads now show both web and Remotion paths
- asset-setup SKILL.md updated with web-first guidance and new plugin name
- Brand skill: clarified Core Brand vs. Monochrome mode — educational/training content uses Core Brand (not Monochrome)

### Optimized
- Brand asset images resized to max 1920px, JPEG quality 85, 72 DPI — archive reduced from ~278MB to ~75MB
- Removed legacy `images/` directory (superseded by `backgrounds/gradient/`)
- `seamless-texture.jpg` reduced from 4096x4096 (25MB) to 1024x1024 (~1MB)

### Unchanged
- All Remotion skills (remotion-spec, remotion-builder, remotion-best-practices) preserved without modification

## [1.1.0] - April 9, 2026

### Changed
- Rebrand from "ElevenLabs Academy Plugin" to "ElevenLabs Remotion Kit"
- Update README to reflect current skills (removed lesson-builder and project-context references)
- Update plugin.json name, description, and repo URL
- Consolidate skills: merge lesson-author into lesson-builder, rename remotion-spec to remotion-spec-builder

### Fixed

## [1.0.0] - April 4, 2026
