# ElevenLabs Brand Kit — Asset Setup

This skill downloads the official ElevenLabs brand asset pack and sets up a project to use them. It supports two storage modes: **project-local** (assets live inside the project) or **central** (single shared copy across all projects).

## Overview

Brand assets are distributed as a versioned zip from GitHub Releases. The zip contains:
- `brand-assets/` — backgrounds, icons, voice orbs, logos, diagrams, screenshots, images, color tokens, brand guidelines, visual catalogs, and fonts

**Note on fonts:** KMR Waldenburg OTFs are bundled inside `brand-assets/fonts/`. During installation they are copied to both `public/brand-assets/fonts/` (for the catalog) and `public/fonts/` (for web font loading / Remotion staticFile()). Both locations are populated automatically.

**Current version:** `v3.1.0`
**Download URL:** `https://github.com/jakerains/elevenlabs-brand-kit/releases/download/v3.1.0/brand-assets-v3.1.zip`

---

## Step 0: Pre-Flight Check

**Run these checks silently before asking the user anything.** Both can run in parallel.

**Check existing config + project state:**
```bash
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json"
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
  INSTALLED_VERSION=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE')).get('assetVersion','none'))" 2>/dev/null)
  ASSET_LOCATION=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE')).get('assetLocation','none'))" 2>/dev/null)
  CENTRAL_PATH=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE')).get('centralPath',''))" 2>/dev/null)
else
  INSTALLED_VERSION="none"
  ASSET_LOCATION="none"
fi

# Check if this project already has brand assets linked/installed
if [ -L "public/brand-assets" ]; then
  PROJECT_STATUS="linked"
elif [ -d "public/brand-assets" ]; then
  PROJECT_STATUS="local"
else
  PROJECT_STATUS="none"
fi
```

**Check GitHub for the latest release:**
```bash
LATEST_INFO=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jakerains/elevenlabs-brand-kit/releases/latest)
LATEST_VERSION=$(echo "$LATEST_INFO" | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tag_name'])" 2>/dev/null)
ASSET_URL=$(echo "$LATEST_INFO" | python3 -c "import json,sys; assets=json.load(sys.stdin)['assets']; print(next(a['browser_download_url'] for a in assets if a['name'].endswith('.zip')))" 2>/dev/null)
```

Based on these results, proceed to **Step 1**.

---

## Step 1: Route & Setup

Based on the pre-flight results from Step 0, follow **exactly one path:**

### Path A — Existing central install, assets current

**Condition:** Config exists, `assetLocation` is `"central"`, version matches latest, and central assets directory exists.

This is the fast path — assets are already downloaded centrally. Just link this project and set up the right tooling.

**Tell the user:**
> Brand assets already set up centrally (v$INSTALLED_VERSION). I'll link this project to your shared assets.

**Ask project type only** — no storage question needed since they already chose central:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What kind of project are you linking?",
    header: "Project type",
    options: [
      { label: "Just the brand assets", description: "Link brand-assets only — no npm packages, no project-specific guidance" },
      { label: "HTML / web project", description: "Link brand assets and surface web-specific guidance (CSS tokens, React, Tailwind, shadcn)" },
      { label: "Remotion video project", description: "Link brand assets and bootstrap Remotion dependencies" },
      { label: "Presentations", description: "Link brand assets for creating branded PowerPoint decks" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

Store as `PROJECT_TYPE`. Then → **Step 4** (link) → **Step 5** (verify) → project-specific bootstrap if needed.

### Path B — Existing install, version outdated

**Condition:** Config exists, version doesn't match latest.

Ask if they want to update:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Update available: your assets are at v$INSTALLED_VERSION — v$LATEST_VERSION is available. Want me to update now?",
    header: "Update",
    options: [
      { label: "Yes, update now", description: "Download and install the latest brand assets" },
      { label: "No, skip", description: "Keep the current version and just link this project" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

Then ask project type (same UI as Path A). If update → **Step 3** (download, use existing `ASSET_LOCATION`) → **Step 4** (link if central) → **Step 5** (verify). If skip → **Step 4** (link if central) → **Step 5** (verify).

### Path C — First-time setup (no config)

**Condition:** No config file exists (`INSTALLED_VERSION="none"`).

Full setup flow — ask both questions in sequence:

**C1: Project Type**

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What kind of project are you setting up?",
    header: "Project type",
    options: [
      { label: "Just the brand assets", description: "Install brand-assets only — no npm packages, no project-specific guidance. Good for reference use or pulling individual files. Includes the visual catalog (index.html)" },
      { label: "HTML / web project", description: "Install brand assets and surface web-specific guidance (CSS tokens, React, Tailwind, shadcn)" },
      { label: "Remotion video project", description: "Install brand assets and bootstrap Remotion dependencies" },
      { label: "Presentations", description: "Install brand assets for creating branded PowerPoint decks" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

Store as `PROJECT_TYPE`. If the user picks "Other" (the auto-provided escape hatch), treat it as `assets`.

**C2: Storage Preference**

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Where should I store the brand assets?",
    header: "Storage",
    options: [
      { label: "Project-local", description: "Downloads assets into this project's public/ directory. Each project gets its own copy. Best for single-project workflows." },
      { label: "Central (shared)", description: "Downloads once to ~/.elevenlabs-kit/ and symlinks into each project. Saves disk space — best for multiple ElevenLabs projects." }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

Store as `STORAGE_PREF`. Then → **Step 3** (download) → **Step 4** (link if central) → **Step 5** (verify) → project-specific bootstrap.

### Path D — Config exists, assets missing or broken

**Condition:** Config exists but assets can't be found at the configured location.

Tell the user assets are missing. Ask project type (same UI as Path A), then re-download using the stored `ASSET_LOCATION` → **Step 3** → **Step 4** (link if central) → **Step 5** (verify).

### Path E — Project already linked/installed, assets current

**Condition:** `PROJECT_STATUS` is `"linked"` or `"local"` AND version matches latest.

Assets are already in this project and up to date. Tell the user:
> Brand assets already installed in this project (v$INSTALLED_VERSION) — everything is current.

Ask project type for post-setup guidance only — no download or linking needed. Skip to project-specific bootstrap if applicable, then show the **After Setup** guidance for their project type.

---

## Step 3: Download and Extract Assets

### Download the zip

Use `$ASSET_URL` and `$LATEST_VERSION` from Step 0. If the pre-flight GitHub check failed (no network), fall back to the hardcoded URL below.

```bash
# $ASSET_URL and $LATEST_VERSION set in Step 0
# Fallback if network check failed:
ASSET_URL="${ASSET_URL:-https://github.com/jakerains/elevenlabs-brand-kit/releases/download/v3.1.0/brand-assets-v3.1.zip}"
LATEST_VERSION="${LATEST_VERSION:-2.1.0}"
TEMP_ZIP="/tmp/elevenlabs-brand-assets-latest.zip"

curl -L -o "$TEMP_ZIP" "$ASSET_URL"
echo "Downloaded $(du -h "$TEMP_ZIP" | cut -f1) — version $LATEST_VERSION"
```

### Option 1: Project-Local Storage

```bash
# Extract directly into the project
mkdir -p public/brand-assets public/fonts
unzip -o "$TEMP_ZIP" -d /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract

# Copy all brand assets (fonts are inside brand-assets/fonts/)
cp -r /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract/brand-assets/* public/brand-assets/

# Also copy fonts to public/fonts/ — required for Remotion's staticFile() font loading
cp -r /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract/brand-assets/fonts/* public/fonts/

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract "$TEMP_ZIP"

echo "Brand assets installed to public/brand-assets/"
echo "Fonts installed to public/fonts/ (also at public/brand-assets/fonts/)"
```

Save config:
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit"
cat > "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json" << CONFIGEOF
{
  "assetLocation": "project-local",
  "assetVersion": "${LATEST_VERSION#v}",
  "lastUpdated": "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
}
CONFIGEOF
```

### Option 2: Central (Shared) Storage

```bash
CENTRAL_DIR="$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit"
mkdir -p "$CENTRAL_DIR"

# Extract to central location
unzip -o "$TEMP_ZIP" -d "$CENTRAL_DIR"

# Clean up temp
rm -f "$TEMP_ZIP"

echo "Brand assets installed to $CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/"
echo "Fonts installed to $CENTRAL_DIR/fonts/"
```

Then create symlinks in the current project:
```bash
# Create public/ if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p public

# Remove existing directories/symlinks if present
rm -rf public/brand-assets public/fonts

# Symlink brand-assets to central store
ln -s "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/brand-assets" public/brand-assets

# Fonts are inside brand-assets/fonts/ — symlink that subdirectory to public/fonts/
ln -s "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/brand-assets/fonts" public/fonts

echo "Symlinked public/brand-assets → $CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/"
echo "Symlinked public/fonts → $CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/fonts/"
```

Save config:
```bash
cat > "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json" << CONFIGEOF
{
  "assetLocation": "central",
  "centralPath": "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit",
  "assetVersion": "${LATEST_VERSION#v}",
  "lastUpdated": "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
}
CONFIGEOF
```

### Write brand context files

Write `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to `~/.elevenlabs-kit/` so any AI agent that accesses the central asset store has full brand context, color tokens, typography rules, icon selection guidance, and a compliance checklist.

Read the template files from this skill's `templates/` directory:
- `templates/central-CLAUDE.md` → Write to `$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/CLAUDE.md`
- `templates/central-AGENTS.md` → Write to `$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/AGENTS.md`

These files ensure any agent — Claude, Copilot, Cursor, or otherwise — that peeks into the central store knows exactly how to stay on-brand without needing the plugin installed.

---

## Step 4: Link Central Assets to a New Project

When using central storage and setting up a **new** project (assets already downloaded), just create the symlinks:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json"

# Verify central assets exist
CENTRAL_DIR=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE'))['centralPath'])" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -d "$CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets" ]; then
  mkdir -p public
  rm -rf public/brand-assets public/fonts
  ln -s "$CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets" public/brand-assets
  ln -s "$CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/fonts" public/fonts
  echo "Linked to central assets at $CENTRAL_DIR"
else
  echo "Central assets not found — run full setup first"
fi
```

---

## Step 5: Verify Installation

```bash
echo "=== Asset Verification ==="
echo "Backgrounds: $(find public/brand-assets/backgrounds -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') files"
echo "  - Gradient: $(ls public/brand-assets/backgrounds/gradient/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "  - Agents: $(ls public/brand-assets/backgrounds/agents/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "  - Chladni: $(ls public/brand-assets/backgrounds/chladni-closeup/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Icons: $(find public/brand-assets/icons -name '*.png' -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') PNG files"
echo "Voice Orbs: $(ls public/brand-assets/voice-orbs/*.jpg 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Logos: $(find public/brand-assets/logos -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Fonts: $(ls public/fonts/*.otf 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') OTF files"
echo ""

# Check if symlinked or direct
if [ -L "public/brand-assets" ]; then
  echo "Storage: CENTRAL (symlinked to $(readlink public/brand-assets))"
else
  echo "Storage: PROJECT-LOCAL"
fi

echo ""
echo "Config: $(cat "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json" 2>/dev/null || echo 'none')"
```

After verification, tell the user:

> **All done!** Open `public/brand-assets/index.html` in your browser to browse the full asset and component catalog — every background, icon, voice orb, scene, layout, and color token in one place, each with a one-click copy button that outputs a ready-to-paste agent prompt.

### Brand compliance check

After setup completes, invoke `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:brand` to confirm the installed assets are being used correctly and the project is configured for on-brand output. This loads the full brand guidelines into context so all subsequent work in this session adheres to ElevenLabs visual standards.

---

## Repair / Update Mode

### Update assets to a new version

Run asset-setup again — the pre-flight check (Step 0) automatically detects the outdated version and routes to Path B with an update prompt. Central storage only needs one update — all linked projects get it automatically.

### Re-link a project (central mode)

If a project is missing its symlinks but assets exist centrally, run asset-setup — the pre-flight check detects the central install (Path A) and links automatically.

### Switch storage mode

Delete existing assets/symlinks and re-run asset-setup. The pre-flight check will see no assets in the project and route to the appropriate path. If you want to switch from central to project-local (or vice versa), delete `~/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json` first to trigger the full setup flow (Path C) where you can pick a different storage option.

---

## Remotion Project Bootstrap

**Only run this section if `PROJECT_TYPE` is `remotion` (set in Step 1).**

Delegate to Remotion's official scaffolder to create a working project structure, then layer brand assets on top. This keeps the setup future-proof — when Remotion bumps its scaffold, the skill stays correct.

### Scaffold with create-video

```bash
# Scaffold into a temp directory using Remotion's official CLI
SCAFFOLD_DIR="/tmp/remotion-scaffold-$$"
npx create-video@latest "$SCAFFOLD_DIR" --blank
```

If `--blank` is not recognized, try `--template blank`. If the scaffolder prompts interactively, choose the blank/empty template.

### Merge scaffold into the project

Copy source files and config from the scaffold. Do **not** overwrite any existing files:

```bash
# Copy source files (src/index.ts, src/Root.tsx, etc.)
for f in $(find "$SCAFFOLD_DIR/src" -type f 2>/dev/null); do
  REL="${f#$SCAFFOLD_DIR/}"
  if [ ! -f "$REL" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$REL")"
    cp "$f" "$REL"
  fi
done

# Copy config files if they don't exist
for f in remotion.config.ts tsconfig.json; do
  [ ! -f "$f" ] && [ -f "$SCAFFOLD_DIR/$f" ] && cp "$SCAFFOLD_DIR/$f" "$f"
done
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
# Ensure package.json exists
[ ! -f "package.json" ] && npm init -y

# Install runtime + dev deps from the scaffold's package.json
DEPS=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$SCAFFOLD_DIR/package.json')); print(' '.join(d.get('dependencies',{}).keys()))" 2>/dev/null)
DEV_DEPS=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$SCAFFOLD_DIR/package.json')); print(' '.join(d.get('devDependencies',{}).keys()))" 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$DEPS" ] && npm install $DEPS
[ -n "$DEV_DEPS" ] && npm install -D $DEV_DEPS

# Clean up scaffold directory
rm -rf "$SCAFFOLD_DIR"
```

**Fallback** — if the scaffolder fails or is unavailable, install manually:

```bash
# Runtime deps — include React peers explicitly
npm install remotion @remotion/cli @remotion/transitions @remotion/fonts @remotion/light-leaks zod react react-dom

# Dev deps — TypeScript + React types (Remotion entry files are .tsx)
npm install -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Then write the minimum scaffold files: `src/index.ts` (calls `registerRoot()`), `src/Root.tsx` (at least one `<Composition>`), `remotion.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json` (with `"jsx": "react-jsx"`).

### Wire up the studio script

```bash
if ! npm pkg get scripts.studio 2>/dev/null | grep -q "remotion studio"; then
  npm pkg set scripts.studio="remotion studio"
  echo "Added 'studio' script"
else
  echo "'studio' script already configured"
fi
```

### Smoke test

```bash
# Verify React is resolvable (the most common failure mode)
node -e "require('react/jsx-runtime')" && echo "✓ React OK" || echo "✗ React missing — run: npm install react react-dom"

# Verify Remotion CLI is working
npx remotion versions && echo "✓ Remotion OK" || echo "✗ Remotion broken"
```

**After bootstrap, tell the user:**
> Remotion is ready. Launch the studio anytime with `studio` — it'll open Remotion Studio in your browser for previewing and editing compositions.

---

## Config File Reference

Location: `~/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json`

```json
{
  "assetLocation": "central | project-local",
  "centralPath": "/Users/you/.elevenlabs-kit",
  "assetVersion": "2.1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-04-05"
}
```

This file is read by all ElevenLabs Brand Kit skills to locate brand assets. When `assetLocation` is `"central"`, skills resolve asset paths through `centralPath` instead of expecting them in the project directory.

---

## After Setup

**First: open the catalog.** `public/brand-assets/index.html` in any browser. Every background, icon, voice orb, scene component, layout, and color token — all with one-click copy buttons that output ready-to-paste agent prompts. Use this to find the right assets before building anything.

**Then, based on your project type:**

**If assets-only (`PROJECT_TYPE=assets`):**
> The brand assets are installed at `public/brand-assets/` (images, icons, voice orbs, logos) and `public/fonts/` (KMR Waldenburg). Open `public/brand-assets/index.html` to browse the visual catalog. You can reference them directly or pull individual files as needed.
> Use `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:brand` to check brand compliance on anything you build.

**If HTML/web (`PROJECT_TYPE=html`):**
> Reference `public/brand-assets/` for images and `public/fonts/` for KMR Waldenburg. Open `public/brand-assets/index.html` to browse the visual catalog.
> Use `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:branded-web` for guidance on implementing brand patterns in CSS/React/Tailwind.
> Use `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:brand` to check brand compliance on anything you build.

**If Remotion (`PROJECT_TYPE=remotion`):**
> You're ready to build. The typical flow:
> 1. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:remotion-spec-builder` — plan your scenes (layout, mode, content, duration)
> 2. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:remotion-builder` — generate the React/TypeScript code from the spec
> 3. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:remotion-best-practices` — load if you need Remotion API reference while building

**If presentations (`PROJECT_TYPE=pptx`):**
> You're ready to create branded decks. The typical flow:
> 1. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:eleven-branded-pptx` — create ElevenLabs-branded PowerPoint presentations from the included 30-slide template
> 2. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:brand` — check brand compliance on your content
> Requires the `/pptx` skill for file tooling.
