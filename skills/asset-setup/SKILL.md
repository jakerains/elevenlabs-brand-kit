# ElevenLabs Brand Kit — Asset Setup

This skill downloads the official ElevenLabs brand asset pack and sets up a project to use them. It supports two storage modes: **project-local** (assets live inside the project) or **central** (single shared copy across all projects).

## Overview

Brand assets are distributed as a versioned zip from GitHub Releases. The zip contains:
- `brand-assets/` — backgrounds, icons, voice orbs, logos, diagrams, screenshots, images, color tokens, brand guidelines, visual catalogs, and fonts

**Note on fonts:** KMR Waldenburg OTFs are bundled inside `brand-assets/fonts/`. During installation they are copied to both `public/brand-assets/fonts/` (for the catalog) and `public/fonts/` (for web font loading / Remotion staticFile()). Both locations are populated automatically.

**Current version:** `v3.1.0`
**Download URL:** `https://github.com/jakerains/elevenlabs-brand-kit/releases/download/v3.1.0/brand-assets-v3.1.zip`

---

## Step 0: Identify Project Type

**Ask this first — before doing anything else:**

> **What kind of project are you setting up?**
>
> 1. **Remotion video project** — I'll install brand assets and bootstrap Remotion dependencies
> 2. **HTML / web project** — I'll install brand assets only, no npm packages
> 3. **Other / not sure** — I'll install brand assets and you can tell me what else you need

Wait for the response and store it as `PROJECT_TYPE` (remotion / html / other). This determines whether the Remotion bootstrap step runs at the end.

---

## Step 1: Check Latest Version + Existing Config

Run both checks in parallel before doing anything else.

**Check GitHub for the latest release:**
```bash
LATEST_INFO=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jakerains/elevenlabs-brand-kit/releases/latest)
LATEST_VERSION=$(echo "$LATEST_INFO" | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tag_name'])" 2>/dev/null)
ASSET_URL=$(echo "$LATEST_INFO" | python3 -c "import json,sys; assets=json.load(sys.stdin)['assets']; print(next(a['browser_download_url'] for a in assets if a['name'].endswith('.zip')))" 2>/dev/null)
echo "Latest version: $LATEST_VERSION"
echo "Download URL: $ASSET_URL"
```

**Check existing config:**
```bash
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json"
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
  INSTALLED_VERSION=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE')).get('assetVersion','none'))" 2>/dev/null)
  ASSET_LOCATION=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE')).get('assetLocation','none'))" 2>/dev/null)
  CENTRAL_PATH=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE')).get('centralPath',''))" 2>/dev/null)
  echo "Installed version: $INSTALLED_VERSION  Location: $ASSET_LOCATION"
else
  INSTALLED_VERSION="none"
  ASSET_LOCATION="none"
fi
```

**Decision logic — follow exactly one path:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No config (`INSTALLED_VERSION="none"`) | Go to **Step 2** (ask storage preference) |
| Config exists, version matches latest, assets exist at configured location | Tell user assets are current. If this is a new project in central mode, go to **Step 4** to link. Otherwise done. |
| Config exists, version is **outdated** | Tell the user there's an update available and ask if they want to install it (see prompt below). If yes — skip Step 2, use stored `ASSET_LOCATION`, go to **Step 3**. If no — stop. |
| Config exists but assets are missing/broken | Tell the user assets are missing and re-download using stored preference — go to **Step 3**. |

**Update prompt (use when version is outdated):**

> **Update available:** your assets are at v`$INSTALLED_VERSION` — v`$LATEST_VERSION` is available.
>
> Changes in this release are in the GitHub changelog. Want me to update now? (yes / no)

Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Ask the User Where to Store Assets

**Only reach this step if no config exists (first-time setup).** Present the two options clearly:

> **Where should I store the brand assets?**
>
> 1. **Project-local** — Downloads assets directly into this project's `public/` directory. Each project gets its own copy. Best if you only work on one project at a time.
>
> 2. **Central (shared)** — Downloads assets once to `~/.elevenlabs-kit/` and creates symlinks in each project. All projects share the same assets — saves disk space and keeps everything in sync. Best if you work across multiple ElevenLabs projects.
>
> Which do you prefer? (1 or 2)

Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

---

## Step 3: Download and Extract Assets

### Download the zip

Use `$ASSET_URL` and `$LATEST_VERSION` from Step 1. If Step 1 failed to fetch (no network), fall back to the hardcoded URL below.

```bash
# $ASSET_URL and $LATEST_VERSION set in Step 1
# Fallback if network check failed:
ASSET_URL="${ASSET_URL:-https://github.com/jakerains/elevenlabs-brand-kit/releases/download/v3.1.0/brand-assets-v3.1.zip}"
LATEST_VERSION="${LATEST_VERSION:-2.1.0}"
TEMP_ZIP="/tmp/elevenlabs-brand-assets-latest.zip"

curl -L -o "$TEMP_ZIP" "$ASSET_URL"
echo "Downloaded $(du -h "$TEMP_ZIP" | cut -f1) — version $LATEST_VERSION"
```

### Option 1: Project-Local Storage

```bash
# Extract directly into the project
mkdir -p public/brand-assets public/fonts
unzip -o "$TEMP_ZIP" -d /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract

# Copy all brand assets (fonts are inside brand-assets/fonts/)
cp -r /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract/brand-assets/* public/brand-assets/

# Also copy fonts to public/fonts/ — required for Remotion's staticFile() font loading
cp -r /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract/brand-assets/fonts/* public/fonts/

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/elevenlabs-assets-extract "$TEMP_ZIP"

echo "Brand assets installed to public/brand-assets/"
echo "Fonts installed to public/fonts/ (also at public/brand-assets/fonts/)"
```

Save config:
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit"
cat > "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json" << CONFIGEOF
{
  "assetLocation": "project-local",
  "assetVersion": "${LATEST_VERSION#v}",
  "lastUpdated": "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
}
CONFIGEOF
```

### Option 2: Central (Shared) Storage

```bash
CENTRAL_DIR="$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit"
mkdir -p "$CENTRAL_DIR"

# Extract to central location
unzip -o "$TEMP_ZIP" -d "$CENTRAL_DIR"

# Clean up temp
rm -f "$TEMP_ZIP"

echo "Brand assets installed to $CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/"
echo "Fonts installed to $CENTRAL_DIR/fonts/"
```

Then create symlinks in the current project:
```bash
# Create public/ if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p public

# Remove existing directories/symlinks if present
rm -rf public/brand-assets public/fonts

# Symlink brand-assets to central store
ln -s "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/brand-assets" public/brand-assets

# Fonts are inside brand-assets/fonts/ — symlink that subdirectory to public/fonts/
ln -s "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/brand-assets/fonts" public/fonts

echo "Symlinked public/brand-assets → $CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/"
echo "Symlinked public/fonts → $CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/fonts/"
```

Save config:
```bash
cat > "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json" << CONFIGEOF
{
  "assetLocation": "central",
  "centralPath": "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit",
  "assetVersion": "${LATEST_VERSION#v}",
  "lastUpdated": "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
}
CONFIGEOF
```

---

## Step 4: Link Central Assets to a New Project

When using central storage and setting up a **new** project (assets already downloaded), just create the symlinks:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json"

# Verify central assets exist
CENTRAL_DIR=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$CONFIG_FILE'))['centralPath'])" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -d "$CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets" ]; then
  mkdir -p public
  rm -rf public/brand-assets public/fonts
  ln -s "$CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets" public/brand-assets
  ln -s "$CENTRAL_DIR/brand-assets/fonts" public/fonts
  echo "Linked to central assets at $CENTRAL_DIR"
else
  echo "Central assets not found — run full setup first"
fi
```

---

## Step 5: Verify Installation

```bash
echo "=== Asset Verification ==="
echo "Backgrounds: $(find public/brand-assets/backgrounds -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') files"
echo "  - Gradient: $(ls public/brand-assets/backgrounds/gradient/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "  - Agents: $(ls public/brand-assets/backgrounds/agents/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "  - Chladni: $(ls public/brand-assets/backgrounds/chladni-closeup/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Icons: $(find public/brand-assets/icons -name '*.png' -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') PNG files"
echo "Voice Orbs: $(ls public/brand-assets/voice-orbs/*.jpg 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Logos: $(find public/brand-assets/logos -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Fonts: $(ls public/fonts/*.otf 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') OTF files"
echo ""

# Check if symlinked or direct
if [ -L "public/brand-assets" ]; then
  echo "Storage: CENTRAL (symlinked to $(readlink public/brand-assets))"
else
  echo "Storage: PROJECT-LOCAL"
fi

echo ""
echo "Config: $(cat "$HOME/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json" 2>/dev/null || echo 'none')"
```

After verification, tell the user:

> **All done!** Open `public/brand-assets/index.html` in your browser to browse the full asset and component catalog — every background, icon, voice orb, scene, layout, and color token in one place, each with a one-click copy button that outputs a ready-to-paste agent prompt.

---

## Repair / Update Mode

### Update assets to a new version

Run Step 1 — it checks GitHub for the latest version and compares against the installed version automatically. If an update is available, it will prompt before downloading. Central storage only needs one update — all linked projects get it automatically.

### Re-link a project (central mode)

If a project is missing its symlinks but assets exist centrally, run Step 4.

### Switch storage mode

Delete existing assets/symlinks and re-run from Step 2 with the new choice. The config will be updated automatically.

---

## Remotion Project Bootstrap

**Only run this section if `PROJECT_TYPE` is `remotion` (set in Step 0).**

First check whether Remotion is already installed:

```bash
if [ -f "package.json" ] && grep -q '"remotion"' package.json; then
  echo "Remotion already installed — skipping npm install"
else
  echo "Installing Remotion dependencies..."
  npm install remotion @remotion/cli @remotion/transitions @remotion/fonts @remotion/light-leaks zod
fi
```

Then verify TypeScript (only if tsconfig.json exists):
```bash
if [ -f "tsconfig.json" ]; then
  npx tsc --noEmit
fi
```

---

## Config File Reference

Location: `~/.elevenlabs-kit/config.json`

```json
{
  "assetLocation": "central | project-local",
  "centralPath": "/Users/you/.elevenlabs-kit",
  "assetVersion": "2.1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-04-05"
}
```

This file is read by all ElevenLabs Brand Kit skills to locate brand assets. When `assetLocation` is `"central"`, skills resolve asset paths through `centralPath` instead of expecting them in the project directory.

---

## After Setup

**First: open the catalog.** `public/brand-assets/index.html` in any browser. Every background, icon, voice orb, scene component, layout, and color token — all with one-click copy buttons that output ready-to-paste agent prompts. Use this to find the right assets before building anything.

**Then, based on your project type:**

**If HTML/web (`PROJECT_TYPE=html`):**
> Reference `public/brand-assets/` for images and `public/fonts/` for KMR Waldenburg.
> Use `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:branded-web` for guidance on implementing brand patterns in CSS/React/Tailwind.
> Use `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:elevenlabs-brand` to check brand compliance on anything you build.

**If Remotion (`PROJECT_TYPE=remotion`):**
> You're ready to build. The typical flow:
> 1. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:remotion-spec-builder` — plan your scenes (layout, mode, content, duration)
> 2. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:remotion-builder` — generate the React/TypeScript code from the spec
> 3. `/elevenlabs-brand-kit:remotion-best-practices` — load if you need Remotion API reference while building

**If other (`PROJECT_TYPE=other`):**
> Ask what they're building — then suggest the relevant skills from above.
